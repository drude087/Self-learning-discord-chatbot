Project Description:

This project implements an interactive question-answering Discord bot using the Discord.py library. The bot reads and responds to user queries by providing answers from a pre-defined database. If the bot cannot find an exact match for a question, it prompts the user for an explanation and updates its database with the new question and answer provided by the user.

Features:

Question-Answering Bot: Analyzes user messages and responds with answers from a pre-defined database of questions and answers.

Database Interaction: Loads and saves question-answer pairs from and to a JSON file, allowing for dynamic expansion of the bot's knowledge base.

User Interaction: Prompts users for explanations when it cannot find a match for a question and updates its database with new question-answer pairs provided by users.

Implementation Details:

Discord Bot Setup: Utilizes the Discord.py library to create and interact with a Discord bot, enabling real-time communication with users.

Database Management: Reads and writes question-answer pairs from and to a JSON file, allowing for easy storage and retrieval of information.

Message Processing: Listens for user messages and processes them to identify questions, find matches in the database, or prompt users for explanations.

Usage:
